## Introduction
The goal of this project would be to predict car traffic in Tampere. At the moment I have a website hosted in AWS, that shows current traffic amounts on certain intersections.
To do:
  1. Continue collecting data
  2. Analyze and clean data (There seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the reported traffic amounts by the traffic detectors)
  3. Form a statistical model (some time series model probably the best for this problem)
  4. Test the model and implement it on the website
  5. Finish website UI, maybe show some graphs, reliability of the predictions etc.
